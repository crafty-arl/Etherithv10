# Etherith Testing Framework

## Testing Strategy - Definition of Done

Every component must pass comprehensive testing before being considered "done":

### 📊 **High-Level Tests (System & User Acceptance)**

1. **User Journey Tests** - End-to-end workflows
2. **PWA Compliance Tests** - Installation, offline, performance
3. **Cross-Device Tests** - Mobile, tablet, desktop responsiveness
4. **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG AA compliance
5. **Performance Tests** - Lighthouse scores >90

### 🔬 **Low-Level Tests (Unit & Integration)**

1. **Component Unit Tests** - React component behavior
2. **Hook Tests** - Custom hook functionality
3. **API Integration Tests** - DXOS, IPFS, NextAuth
4. **State Management Tests** - Data flow and mutations
5. **Error Handling Tests** - Edge cases and failures

### 🎯 **Test Coverage Requirements**

- **Unit Tests**: >85% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical user paths
- **E2E Tests**: Primary user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI integration

### 🚀 **Test Commands**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

### ✅ **Definition of Done Checklist**
